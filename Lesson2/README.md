* Course Notebooks belong to ![Engin Deniz ALPMAN.](https://github.com/EnginAlpman)

* We discussed Deep Learning subjects in detail in the course notebooks. We learned the mathematical background of building a model from scratch. We created various layers and wrote functions, as well as CNN layers. 

* We transferred all this math to the computer with the Torch module and ran it. The main reason for using Torch is to be able to perform tensor operations with CUDA over the GPU.

* Notebooks of the lesson : Inside the folder named "Notebook".

* My homework : Inside the folder named Homework and Research_homework.
